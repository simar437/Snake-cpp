## About The Project

Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player 
maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being 
a primary obstacle. If the Snake touches the line, it dies. The main
objective of the game is to grow the Snake as much as possible by eating
fruits. This increases the score of the Player.

#### How to Play:
 - W,A,S,D to change direction of the Snake.
 - Eat the Fruit to Make the Snake Grow. With each fruit 10 Points will
   be Added to the score.
 - If Snake eats itself, game will be over.
